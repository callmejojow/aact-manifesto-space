    bio: 'Love Intersections is a media arts collective made up of queer artists of colour dedicated to using collaborative art making and relational storytelling to address systemic racism in our communities. We produce intersectional and intergenerational stories from underrepresented communities of colour – centering the invisible, the spiritual, the metaphysical, and the imaginary. We believe in deep and meaningful relationships, that intersectionality is a verb and a call to action, that we must cultivate social trust through collective care and community responsibility. Our desire is to provoke (he)artful social change through a lens of love.\n' +

    description: "This video installation employs the metaphor of the Chinese Five Elements to explore the discursive formation of queer Chinese diasporic identity from a non-Eurocentric/Western point of departure. In Traditional Chinese Medicine, the Five Elemental forces provide many applications to understanding daily life, identity, and relationships in addition to physical, mental, and emotional health. The elements help to approach and understand ways of “being” through principles of metaphysics and temporalities. We invoke these five elements in this installation as a conduit to understanding queer East Asian cultural formations, not as an intellectual delineation, but to interpret our own embodiment of queer Chinese, diasporic identities.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "We performed an ancestral veneration ceremony at Larwill Park in Vancouver, which was the gathering site of the anti-Oriental riots of 1907 to mark an image of the temporal relationship that the project Yellow Peril: Queer Destiny has amongst a history of anti-Asian racism in Canada.  Giving offerings to our ancestors, reflecting on histories of colonization, founded upon systemic racism, and recognizing that these formations of anti-Asian racism and yellow peril exist to uphold imperialism - and never really goes away. Drawing on Simeon Mann and Dylan Rodriguez, Anti-Asian racism emerges when there’s an insecurity around the capitalist mode of production predicated on the seizure and extraction of Indigenous lands, and that anti-Asian violence is a structure to sustain racial devices inherent in racial capitalism and settler colonialism.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Race, temporality, ancestry, and our relationships to land are themes that we grapple with in this project. A core part of our recent practice as queer Chinese artists is exploring the relationship between our identities as queer Asian artists and how our anti-racist arts practice can work in solidarity with struggles to decolonize. We are particularly interested in the recent (re)emergence of Anti-Asian racism and community (and governmental) responses that lean towards identity-based politics. We are interested in creating works that address systemic racism and colonization, and the roles that queer Chinese people play in undoing anti-Black and anti-Indigenous racism.",

Being East-Asian and born in Toronto, although I may ethnically be Japanese and Chinese, I am culturally and nationally Canadian. I would categorize my identity and behaviour mostly in a Western sense drizzled and spiced with my ethnic identity and upbringing.

As an artist and overall creative being, self-expression is inherent in everything I do. I've thought very critically about how I can be a walking representation of my people: I've gone through waves of dressing in my culture's clothing to express my cultural identity, while styling it to my tastes and adhering to my queerness. This naturally fluctuates as more elements of my identity become more pronounced on any given day, but that's just a testament to the multiplicity of what makes me, me! \n" +

Consistently pleasing my family’s views on sacrifice and big picture living left me disconnected from my reality and identity.

This includes the hairy outside that I’m mildly allergic to that makes my throat itchy, the soft juicy insides that makes a mess and the oddly shaped pit that I spend way too much time analyzing every time I eat one.

My idea of resilience and dedication was shaped by my mother and the environment around us. I saw her selfless commitment to what she cares about, and so like my mother, I have a sense of responsibility and give care earnestly. I’m aware of the physical toll and the always-present guilt of not doing or being enough, but I would rather that than not to help.\n" +

    description: "<em>Mother’s Tongue</em> is a temporal sculpture and prose reflecting on the ever-changing nature of memory, identity, and tradition. Created in 2020 during a time of instability and discomfort, the tandem pieces explore finding solace in tradition, ritual, and food. This piece was originally conceived as a way to connect with my cultural ancestors but upon reevaluation, I recognize now I was also searching for connection with my queer ancestors. \n" +
        "\n" +
        "<em>Mother’s Tongue</em> is a manifestation of my discomfort with my queer identity. The sculpture consists of polymer clay dumplings encased in gelatine. The unstable fluid materiality of the gelatine captures my relationship to my queerness while the encased clay dumplings are representative of my Asian identity. The two identities are frequently at odds with one another, existing in a state of suspension and tension. From the material tension of the sculpture to the underlying tension within my writing, both forms are trying to contain the multitudes of what is undefinable, capturing a moment in time and suspending it in space. \n" +
